# Profitability-Reporting-and-Regional-Sales-Insights-for-Retail-Company

## Business Overview
Vision Retail is a nationwide retail chain with over 30 stores, offering a diverse range of products across different regions in the United States. With stores varying in size from 57,000 to 103,000 square feet, the company faces challenges in managing both operational costs and sales performance efficiently. Each store experiences a fixed weekly cost of rent and wages, while sales targets range from $600,000 to $700,000. Vision Retail has been struggling with profitability consistency, where some stores are exceeding their sales targets while others lag behind due to high fixed costs or declining sales. To maintain competitive growth, the executive team needs better visibility into the financial performance of each store, the ability to analyze regional performance, and insights into how to optimize store-level operations to boost profitability. The need for comprehensive financial and sales data analysis is paramount for Vision Retail to make data-driven decisions and improve its bottom line.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic PowerBI P&L financial dashboard to help Vision Retail gain valuable insights into its financial and operational performance. By consolidating data across 2,600+ records, including sales, wages, rent, and other operational costs, created an interactive PowerBI dashboard that enabled Vision Retail's executive team to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as gross margin (GM%), EBIT%, and sales growth (YoY) across all stores. The dashboard allowed the team to :
1. Optimize Store-Level Profitability
2. Reduce Operational Costs
3. Enhancing Sales Performance
4. Regional Performance Optimization

Using this dashboard, the company was able to make real-time decisions to optimize its cost structure, enhance sales performance, and improve overall profitability.
